# Workshop - Don't break your customers anymore with contract testing

Delivering a (micro) service only to find out that one has broken the environment is annoying.

In increasingly (micro)service-oriented architectures, checking that a new version of your service will still be able to communicate with others becomes more and more important. 

Contract testing offers a solution to verify interactions during the test phase. 
In this workshop, we will present how to implement contract testing, in particular first guided by the API provider then by the consumer as well as by HTTP calls or messages. 

We will use Spring Cloud Contract, very well integrated with Spring Boot applications, as well as Pact for a front to back interaction having the advantage of being multilingual. 


## Part 1

To have a global view of this part, the following UML diagram shows the relationship of the parts within Spring Cloud Contract:
![Spring Cloud Contract Diagram](spring-cloud-contract-diagram.png)

You can read a bit the [introduction to Spring Cloud Contract](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-contract/2.2.1.RELEASE/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started-introducing-spring-cloud-contract)

In inventory project, the goal is to learn how to test APIs and the groovy DSL. 
- Go to Maven __pom.xml__ and uncomment the Spring Cloud Contract test dependancy and plugin [doc here](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin/) 
- A base testing class is mandatory and configure the parent class of generated test classes. It handles the context needed for the tests. You have to configure the location of base contract class available here `com.devoxx.inventory.contracts.ContractsBase` by configuring the maven plugin with line `<baseClassForTests>` (see here)[https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin/junit.html].
- run `mvn clean test` to see the plugin generate tests in this class `_target/generated-test-sources_/org/springframework/cloud/contract/verifier/tests/ContractVerifierTest.java`.
- The contract `shouldRetrieveAllBooks` should pass now. To better understand, the [Groovy DSL documentation is here](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-contract/2.2.1.RELEASE/reference/html/project-features.html#contract-dsl)
- Uncomment the test `shouldRetrieveBook`. You need to generate again the contract tests. to go fast, use `mvn spring-cloud-contract:generateTests` directly, then run `mvn test` to run the test (or execute `ContractVerifierTest` directly in your IDE). It fails due to wrong url in the controller. You can easily correct it. You can also see the use of [dynamic and regex properties](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-contract/2.2.1.RELEASE/reference/html/project-features.html#contract-dsl-dynamic-properties)
-  **important** : Look how the url is defined, there is two parts : consumer and producer
  - Read more [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/docs/current/reference/html/project-features.html#contract-dsl-regex)
- __info__ : You can test only the relevant fields in the response.
- __info__ : to directly generate the contract tests, use `mvn spring-cloud-contract:generateTests` directly to avoid running full maven build.
- __info__ : For very complex use case, you can also [reference the parameters from the request](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-contract/2.2.1.RELEASE/reference/html/project-features.html#contract-dsl-referencing-request-from-response)
- Uncomment the test `shouldCreateBookIntoInventory` and make it test the create POST endpoint. The problem here is the random UUID. You can either control the UUID generator in the test or use matchers.
  - We want to verify that we receive a POST on /v1/books with as body a JSON Book containing :
    - a name field which is a string, e.g: "Clean code"
    - a price field which is a number, e.g: 49.99
    - and a stock field which is an integer, e.g. 45
  - then we expect the response to have the status Created (Http 201) with as a body a JSON Book containing :
    - an id filed which is an UUID, e.g : "48bd1c8a-4fff-4db7-8967-9a59791415bd"
    - a name field which is a string, e.g: "Clean code"
    - a price field which is a number, e.g: 49.99
    - and a stock field which is an integer, e.g. 45
- Create the contract `shouldReduceStockInInventory` and make it test the reduce stock POST endpoint. You also will have to uncomment it to show some ATDD practices :)
  - we want to verify that we receive a POST on /v1/books/d4d37e73-77a0-4616-8bd2-5ed983d45d14/stock/reduce/2 aka reducing by 2 the number of Java books
  - then we expect the response to have the status OK (Http 200) with as a body a JSON Book containing a stock field which is an integer, e.g. 92
- Do mvn install on inventory project for making stub accessible for consumers


In checkout project, the goal are to learn how to use the contract test as stubs in the consumer and to create a message contract.
- Make `CheckoutApplicationTests.java` tests pass. It's an integration test for the inventory service call to retrieve a book and the checkout controller.
- At the top of the class, begin to add [AutoConfigureStubRunner annotation](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-contract/2.2.1.RELEASE/reference/html/project-features.html#features-stub-runner-retrieving) with ids of the producer you consume (here the inventory project). `ids` looks like this : `groupId:artefactId:+:stubs:portNumber`. You need to also configure `stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL`
- You can now run the test `CheckoutApplicationTests`
- You have an error when consuming the stub. To fix it, you have have to correctly configure restTemplate. Luckily for you, it's just uncommenting the configuration lines for Accept and Content-Type in `CheckoutApplication.java`
- You can also remove the @Disabled on test `should_checkout_order`
- Implement the `shouldSendOrderToDelivery` a contract for a message which is created in method [see Output Triggered by a Method](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-contract/2.2.1.RELEASE/reference/html/project-features.html#contract-dsl-output-triggered-method)
    - Uncomment the MessageVerifier injection dans `ContractsBase.java`
    - Implement `sendOrder` function to send a message to delivery service (you can use the delivery interface)
    - We want to verify that if you trigger `sendOrder` you will have the following output message JSON body :
       - the bookId field which is the UUID, e.g: "d4d37e73-77a0-4616-8bd2-5ed983d45d14"
       - a quantity field which is a number, e.g: 2
       - a clientId field which is a string, e.g: "yannick"
       - and createdAt field the current date time - You can use dependency injection or matchers ;)
- You can now run again the test `CheckoutApplicationTests` to check that the message is sent
- mvn install for making stub accessible for the message consumer

In delivery project:
 - Make test pass in `DeliveryApplicationTests.java` in delivery service to [trigger stub message](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-contract/2.2.1.RELEASE/reference/html/project-features.html#features-messaging-consumer)
   - use the `stubTrigger`to trigger the message using the it's name in the contract.

### Bonus

In checkout project:
- Implement the `shouldCheckoutOrder` contract. Don't forget to add the baseClass and add it in the plugin configuration (same directory as in inventory if you want). You can also use the WireMock stub from inventory contract testing.
  - We want to verify that we receive a POST on /v1/checkouts with as body a JSON Order containing :
       - the bookId field which is the UUID, e.g: "d4d37e73-77a0-4616-8bd2-5ed983d45d14"
       - a quantity field which is a number, e.g: 2
       - and a clientId field which is a string, e.g: "yannick"
  - then we expect the response to have the status OK (Http 200) with as a body a JSON ValidatedOrder containing :
       - the same fields as input but, more importantly, a createdAt field with the current date time. You can use dependency injection or matchers ;) 
- _bonus_ : You can add configuration in yml for stub runner to avoid duplication in the annotations
